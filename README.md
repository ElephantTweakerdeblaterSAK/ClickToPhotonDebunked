# ClickToPhotonDebunked
Click to Photon - one of the most respected ways to measure latency for gaming. What if Click to Photon doesn't represent latency properly at all?

# Introduction
Click to Photon is one of the most respected ways to measure end-to-end latency. From tech YouTubers to multi-trillion dollar companies this method is used all over the tech industry. Click-To-Photon is the time between you clicking your mouse and seeing a response on the screen: ex, shooting in a game. Click to Photon can be measured by manually counting frames using a camera for each shot in game or using a Click-To-Photon device. Click-To-Photon devices typically use a photoresistor or a photodiode. According to TechTeamGB and google a photodiode is more precise. Typically you take at least 100 shots with a camera or a Click-To-Photon device.  There is also a huge range of frames per second these tools capture starting from 1000 fps from high-speed cameras, Nvidias LDAT with 8800 fps, OSLTT cs with 65,000 fps (The tool I'm using), and many more. Enough intro let's dig into the problem with Click-To-Photon. 

# Testing
I took 10 (100 sample tests) of both my everyday computer with no modifications except the best power mode in the Windows 11 settings and also took tests with my PC with virtually no power savers, events, Security mitigations, Static PC algorithms, etc. This should in theory reduce Jitter (The variance in latency) by having fewer settings changing on the whole PC.
Lets first start off by observing the so-called jitter visually with data across all stock and tweaked tests.

These pictures contain about 36 tests each, when we carefully look at these pictures we see tons of jitter, between all of these tests, across both stock and tweaked. This showcases how inconsistent latency really is. Now that you visually see this variance we can now question if each full 100 sample tests translates to consistent stdevs across all tests (spoiler it is absolutely inconsistent).

when we look at the data just for example lets compare test 1 to test 2. Specifically we will compare the standard devation differences in microseconds of The total system Input Lag (End-2-End). But first lets quickly explain standard deviation simply. The Standard deviation allows us to compare variance in a set of data while still keeping it in MS. We see a 54.3841129 ¬µs difference in consistency. But wait the number is so small why does it matter. Well... test 1 vs test 3 has a difference of 216.514923 microseconds üòè Now what just happened, When we look at test 1 vs test 2 we see the difference between them is 54.3841129 ¬µs. Why when I compared test 1 to 3 we saw a 216.514923 ¬µs difference. Its clear that your pc is consistently adapting , sending events, changing frequencies, running background apps, etc. Do you think they are consistently causing a specific amount of jitter? Heck no, think of a computer as a human, things are always going on internally which like a computer is not static. This explains why jitter is not the same every single test in fact no test is even close to the same. Still don't believe me okay let's compare test 2 to test 3. It has a 162.13081 ¬µs difference. You see it is consistently changing and you see it's not because the first test is different because you just started the game for the first time. (knew you were thinking about that) Now let's talk about test 5 as I noted above something was strange about it. Test 5 had a much bigger difference than all the tests. Test 2 vs 5 had a 702.116932 ¬µs difference. Unlike the other tests, it had a higher max latency in the CSV file (you can find this in the repo). First I need to explain how and why I point this out. During the tweaked testing there was an outlier of 62.118 ms I thought it was an issue with me putting on the tool to my display and me accidently moving the CIP Device when putting it on as it was the second test that had the outlier. I also thought that because no number got even close to let alone 20 in the test. But then I looked at Stock on test 6 It was far down in the test and not one of the first. This time was it a 30.642 ms value which is closer to the other values. After all the tests I looked at I concluded that latency is just that strange because of the natural dynamics of the computer. In my final conclusion with all the tests I both of those in a section where I exclude it. So if you believe it's not good or ruins the test, you can find them removed. But it seems to ruin the data when removed and give lower values in variance then all tests (we compared above) which leads me to believe it's just a part of the data. Heres pictures of the outlier in the sets.

You know the routine let's start with test 1 vs 3 as test 2 is one with a very different result causing a big jump. Test 1 vs 3 results in a difference of 4.04983173 Œºs already looks like a much lower variance but as we said latency jitter is really inconsistent even tweaked as you will see. Here is test 1 vs 4 with 111.517062 Œºs. As you can see this data is extremely unreliable. Okay now tests do 3 vs 4 this gives us 115.566894 Œºs difference. As you can see if you were to compare 2 test it can both appear inconsistent and consistent because of jitter. Let me show the huge difference of test 1 vs 2 due to one of the tests being 62.118. The difference ends up being 3297.60884 Œºs which is 3.29760884405615 ms difference !!! You see with the outlier its even huger.


So after all of this, I surely hope you are starting to get an idea of the problem here.
The main problems summarized.
1. Jitter is inconsistent
2. When testing tweaks that make a microsecond difference they will easily blend in because of jitter. The inconsistent amount of jitter means that even a millisecond could not be tested.
3. When comparing stock to tweaked it would be inaccurate due to the jitter always changing.



Lets show 999 samples vs 999 samples now (honestly an individual 100 better showcases the variance) I will show 998 vs 998 to show if you exclude both outliers from stock and tweaked configurations. I put this in a file to ensure the samples were exactly 999 or 998. I deleted the end of the datasets each time instead of deleting random parts to remain consistent.

You can always compare the other latency types. I just look at the total. If you were to look closely at the outlier pictures on top they don't affect the click latency. Im not fully sure what click latency means as its auto firing. Im not the one clicking. Id ask Andrew the creator of the OSLTT CS to understand what it is.
By the way I dont use 1000 samples because test 6 for stock was missing a sample (most likely a bug). If you look at these you can conclude that the tweaked configuration is way better even excluding the outlier. I'm simply going to let you calculate this because it doesn't really matter because we know how inconsistent the data is.
